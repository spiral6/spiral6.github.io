      <p>By the turn of the millenium the internet was well on its way to becoming the ultra-giant network that we know it to be today. For the IT help desk this advancement was realized in the creation of more avenues of support. The two biggest new avenues were <strong><em>email and chat support sessions</em></strong>. Email, which had started its widespread use in the 90’s was now becoming a household term, and chat support was very alluring because it removed the sometimes uncomfortable situations with talking to an IT person on the phone. </p>

      <p>These advancements in help desk technology, coupled with the ever increasing demands of IT in general, caused yet another surge of volume for IT help desks. The mounting pressure put on help desks to provide more and better support with fewer and fewer resources caused many IT shops to rethink the way they were doing support from the ground up. While frameworks such as ITIL had existed since the 1980’s, the 2000’s saw large corporations like Microsoft start using and developing these frameworks in order to streamline their services and improve the delivery of support. The maturing of these frameworks has been a major component of the current and continuing success of the help desk industry.</p>
      <p>While the rest of the world was developing frameworks (among other things), A&amp;M was focused on having the biggest and the best network infrastructure around. Reportedly, at one point in the early 2000’s <em>Texas A&amp;M represented approximately 5% of the bandwidth of the entire internet.</em> This staggering number was due, in no small part, to the massive amount of Napster traffic that was going on at the time. According to a source within the Division of IT, A&amp;M represented nearly <em>50% of all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster">Napster</a> traffic during this time.</em> All of this can be attributed to the network infrastructure that A&amp;M was building at this time, which consisted of a 10MB backbone. </p>
      <p>In terms of its help desk, the 2000’s saw the centralisation of a primary help desk for the university. This help desk became a one-stop shop for any and all questions at the university, and while they couldn’t answer everything that came their way, they focused on becoming a call center that could direct traffic around the university for a huge variety of problems. Obviously, they also handled any number of technology related questions. During this time, Texas A&amp;M’s help desk became one of the largest help desks in higher education. It also became one of the first and one of the few to offer 24/7 support.</p>

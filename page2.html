<p>In many ways, the 1980’s serve as the foundation of the IT help desk as we know it. The growing need for a point of contact between IT service providers and end-users was becoming evident. More and more companies were turning to IT as a solution, but in many cases, there was no official intermediary between the administrators and the customers or end-users. This caused an ever increasing backlog of service tickets, which prevented important problems from being fixed in a timely manner. </p>
<p>The solution was to introduce a position that fielded all of the problems and then send out the problems to the appropriate administrators of those systems. They could also solve the simpler problems directly without having to get the administrators involved. </p>

<p>During this time, Ron Muns founded the Help Desk Institute, which is an organization aimed and dedicated towards serving the IT community and help desk professional through training, standardization, and collaboration. This organization still exists today, and is one of the largest organizations of its kind.</p>
<p>As early as 1987 and possibly before, professors at Texas A&amp;M were starting to use email systems in their classes. They were primitive and driven by terminal systems, but functioned in much the same way that email functions now. Because internet-wide email wasn’t widespread by any means, these systems required users to login to a terminal on campus to access course messages. </p>
